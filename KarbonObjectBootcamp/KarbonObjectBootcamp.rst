Advanced Bootcamp (Automation)
==============================

Topics
------
-  Nutanix Karbon

-  Nutanix Object

-  Nutanix Era

Goal
----

Setup a fully working NextCloud solution, highly available, hosted on a
Kubernetes cluster.

The MariaDB database backend will be deployed and protected using
Nutanix Era solution.

An object storage solution, deployed with Nutanix Object will be used as
an external repository, setup on the NextCloud platform.

Deployment
----------

Connect to your Frame Desktop, using the Frame Jumphost URL, your Frame
User and the Frame Jumphost Password as provided in Ressources lab
document. You’ll stay on this Jumphost for all the lab.

Please change the keyboard layout to UNI, this will use your keyboard
layout.

|image2|

In the Lab guide we use the word “burger” It’s the menu start on the top
left of Prism Central, which look like this |image3|

Please use the **Google Chrome** browser in the Frame Jumphost for the
entire lab.

As the keyboard mapping, or copy / paste something has some strange
behavior, some scripts / text are available on an AWS Bucket. It will be
indicated how to get it on the documentation when needed.

Objects
-------

**This is a showcase, do not click on create, and click cancel afterwards, as an object store has 
already been created for you.**

-  With Google Chrome, **connect** to the **Prism Central** (as provided
   in Ressources lab document), click on the\ |image4| Burger Menu,click 
   **Services**, click **Objects**
-  Click **Create Object Store** / Continue
-  Enter an object store name based as provided in Ressources lab
   document / next
-  Select performance (Estimated) to Custom. It will deploy a very small
   object instance to save cluster resources for other LAB
   participants.(don’t change vCPU or Memory)
-  Set 100 GiB as capacity / Next
-  Select **your corresponding** Nutanix Cluster
-  Select Managed-Network for both Object Infra Network and Objects
   Public Network. Enter the Objects Infra IPs and Object Public IPs
   with the information provided in Ressources lab document. 

.. hint::

    The creation of an object store is time-consuming and not feasible 
    in this time with parallel staging

Karbon/Kubernetes Cluster
-------------------------

-  Go to **Prism Central**, click on the |image5|\ Burger Menu, click
   Services, click Karbon
-  Click **create a Kubernetes Cluster**

Kubernetes Setup
----------------

-  Go to Prism Central, click on the Burger \ |image4|, Services, 
   Karbon

-  Cluster Clusters / Check your cluster name / Actions / Download
   Kubeconfig. Click on the Download link

-  Save it to ~/Downloads folder leave file name unchanged)

-  Open the file with Notepad, and copy the content of this file

-  Connect to the linux jumphost (with putty as username: yourusername
   (example userxx) pw: nutanix/4u)

To avoid to write every time the **kubectl**, will create an alias

.. code-block:: Bash
    
    alias k=kubectl


Create a folder to host the kubectl config file

.. code-block:: Bash
    
    mkdir ~/.kube

Use **vi** to configure the kubectl config file on the
linux jumphost

.. code-block:: Bash
        
    vi ~/.kube/config

Open the Downloaded kubeconfig file
(~/Downloads/karbon-<TLA>-01-kubectl.cfg in notepad
copy and paste the text) in the following file

.. hint::

Test the kubetcl configuration, an output should be shown

.. code-block:: Bash
    
    k get pods -A
    
Create a folder named metallb

.. code-block:: Bash
    
    mkdir metallb; cd metallb

Install the metallb service with the following commands

.. code-block:: Bash
    
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.9.5/manifests/namespace.yaml
    kubectl apply -f https://karbon-bootcamp.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/metallb.yaml
    kubectl create secret generic -n metallb-system memberlist --from-literal=secretkey="$(openssl rand -base64 128)"

Create a file named metallb-config.yaml with the following content,
be careful to adapt the last line with the information as provided
in ressources lab document, for the field **Karbon MetalLB Pool**

.. code-block:: Bash
        
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      namespace: metallb-system
      name: config
    data:
      config: |
        address-pools:
        - name: default
          protocol: layer2
          addresses:
          - x.x.x.x-y.y.y.y
  
https://karbon-bootcamp.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/metallb-config.txt

-  Configure the metallb setup
  
.. code-block:: Bash
    
    
    k apply -f metallb-config.yaml

Test the current setup, by deploying a basic nginx container

.. code-block:: Bash
    
    k create deployment nginx --image=registry.gitlab.com/fabrice.krebs/nutanix-ch/nginx

Check if the deployed worked

.. code-block:: Bash
    
    k get pods

Expose the deployment behind the metallb load balancer

.. code-block:: Bash
    
    k expose deployment nginx --name nginx --type LoadBalancer --port 80

Get and copy the external IP of the nginx service

.. code-block:: Bash
   
    k get svc

Open a second browser tab and past the IP address. The nginx webpage
should appear. If the test is successful, continue. Otherwise,

.. hint::

If your EXTERNAL-IP is listed as Pending, this indicates an issue with your MetalLB ConfigMap file.
Run kubectl describe configmap config -n metallb-system to verify your IP addresses are correct
Fix your metallb-config.yaml file and run kubectl apply -f metallb-config.yaml again

MariaDB:
--------

Now the MariaDB database server should be deployed. We will need to
retrieve the IP Address from the Era interface. Go back to the Era
Browser Tab:

-  Click on Era text on the Top Left corner

-  Click Dashboard on the Top Left corner / Database / Sources

-  Click on your database server name

-  Under section Database Server VM on the middle of the page, copy the
   IP Address or write it somewhere. We will need it later

NextCloud deployment
--------------------

-  Create a new nextcloud deployment

.. code-block:: Bash
    
    
    k create deployment nextcloud --image=registry.gitlab.com/fabrice.krebs/nutanix-ch/nextcloud

Expose the new deployment to the public network

.. code-block:: Bash
    
    
    k expose deployment nextcloud --type=LoadBalancer --name=nextcloud --port=80 --target-port=80

Retrieve the External-IP address of the deployment

.. code-block:: Bash
    
    
    k get services

Open a new tab and type the external-ip address. You should have the
nextcloud home page available.

-  Do the setup with the following information :

   -  Username : admin

   -  Password : nx2Tech123!

-  **Do not click on Finish yet**

.. hint::

   If you pushed too fast k delete deployment nextcloud ;-)

-  Click on Storage & database / MySQL MariaDB |image6|

   -  Database user : root

   -  Database password : nx2Tech123!

   -  Database name : nextcloud

   -  Replace localhost with the Database IP Address retrieved
      previously

   -  **Unckeck install recommended apps,** as it will take some time
      for applications to be deployed

Click Finish. The initial setup will proceed in a couple of minutes.
You’ll then be able to access the freshly deployed nextcloud.

-  **Do not close the browser TAB**

As the application is still initializing as a background task, the
interface will be a bit slow for a couple of minutes. We will now go to
the next section to create an Object Store bucket, and use it from the
NextCloud application.

Nutanix Object creation
-----------------------

Return to the prism central interface

-  Click on the Burger / Service / Object

-  Generate an access key by clicking on Access Keys on the top / Add
   People / Add people not in a directory service

   -  Email address : your-initial@demo.com

   -  Name : Your name

-  Click Next / Generate Keys / Download Keys (very important as you can
   get it only once)

-  Click on Object Stores on the Top / Click on your cluster

-  Write down somewhere the Object Public IPs assigned from the Existing
   Object Store, we will need it for the nextcloud configuration.

-  Click on Create Bucket

   -  Name : nextcloud-yourinitials

   -  Check Enable versioning

   -  Click create

-  Click on the newly created bucket

-  Go to User Access on the left / Edit User Access

-  Search for people your-initial@demo.com

-  Check permission Read and Write / Save

Add Object Storage to NextCloud 
-------------------------------

Go back to NextCloud Tab:

-  Click on the A on the top right section / Apps

-  Go at the bottom of the windows to find External storage support,
   click on Enable

-  Click on the A on the top right section / Settings

-  On the left side, click on External Storages under the
   **Administration Section** (and not the first Personal section)

   -  Folder Name : external_storage

   -  External Storage : Amazon S3

   -  Authentication : Access Key

   -  Bucket : nextcloud-yourinitals

   -  Hostname : The Object Public IPs you’ve copied previously

   -  Keep Enable SSL unchecked

   -  Keep Enable path Style unchecked

   -  Check Legacy (v2) authentication

   -  Select admin user

   -  Access Key : The access key located on the file you’ve downloaded
      when configuring object

   -  Secret Key : The secret key located on the file you’ve downloaded
      when configuring object

   -  Click on the |image7| icone to verify and validate

-  Now the Object storage is connected, let’s try to upload some files.
   Click on the folder icone on the top left section

-  Click on external storage folder

-  Click on the |image8|\ icone on the top section, and upload a couple
   of files from the local computer. Wait for the upload to be done.
   You should see the uploaded file, which aren’t located on the
   Nextcloud itself, but store on the external object store

Check the Embedded Nutanix Object Browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  With a Web Browser, connect to the Object Public IP Address of the
   Object Store, used when creating your bucket
   (http://x.x.x.x/objectsbrowser/)

-  Enter the Access Key and the Secret Key you’d previously downloaded

-  Check if your uploaded files appear in the bucket to verify your
   configuration/setup

Additional Lab
